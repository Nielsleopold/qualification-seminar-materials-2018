# Programming on your own machine

So far you have been working remotely on Azure. The aim of this session is to move things locally. Here is what you need to do:

1. Open the session repository on GitHub [https://github.com/itu-summer/session-4](github.com/itu-summer/session-4) in your browser. 
2. Notice the three notebooks prefixed with `Installs_`
3. Follow the guide for your platform, and don't be afraid to ask questions
