# Assignment for session 4

In this assignment you'll be working with command-line interfaces (CLIs), pipes and testing.

1. Wrap the programs from Assignment 3 into CLI programs and let them work on books, which are piped into the program.
  * This entails saving them as a Python file and creating a `__main__` method in the Python file. 
  * Hint: You will have to work with program arguments as well

2. Download several Sherlock Holmes books (see below) and run the name analysis on each one of them.
  * See the `list_of_books.txt` file to find more books to download.

3. Wrap your analysis above in a test which specifies a minimum amount of names, which for sure have to be found in the corresponding stories.
  * As an example we expect 'Sherlock' and 'Watson' to appear in this book: http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1661/pg1661.txt
