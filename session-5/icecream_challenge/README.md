# Ice Cream Challenge

Popular belief suggests that Sherlock Holmes is a drug addict, see for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Drug_use.

In this directory, you find a set of Sherlock Holmes books as text files.

Write a program that generates an overview over how often certain drugs is mentioned per book.

For example, the [Wikipedia entry on Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes#Drug_use) says that he consumes amongst others _cocaine_ and _morphine_. The book _"The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes"_ mentions for example _cocaine_ at least three times.

That is, write a program `drug_use.py` that counts per book how often a certain drug is mentioned and print an overview of drug type and amount of mentions. The format of the generated report does not matter as long as it is somewhat understandable.



The person that hands-in a program that prints the most complete and most accurate report of drugs mentioned per book will get two balls of ice cream from Ismejeriet, the ice cream shop opposite ITU.
