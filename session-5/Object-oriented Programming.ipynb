The `__init__()` method creates an instance representing this particular book and sets the `author` and `title` attributes using the values we provided. The `__init__()` method has no explicit return statement, but Python automatically returns an instance representing this book. We store that instance in the variable `empty_book`. The *naming convention* is helpful here: we can usually assume that a capitalized name like `Book` refers to a class, and a lowercase name like `empty_book` refers to a single instance created from a class.\n",

    "The interactive console and debugger call `repr` on te results of the expressions evaluated, as does the `%r` place holder in classic formatting with `%` operator, and the `!r` conversion field in the new Format String Syntax used in the `str.format` method.\n",

    "\n",
    "Contrast `__repr__` with `__str__`, which is called by the `str()` constructor and **implicitly used by the print function**. `__str__` should return **a string suitable for display to end-users**.\n",

    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not always have to start from scratch when writing a class. If the class you are writing is a specialized version of another -readily available- class, you can use inheritance to implement your extensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "When one class inherits from another, it automatically takes on all the attributes and methods of the first class. The original class is called the *parent class*, and the new class is the *child class*. The child class inherits every attribute and method from its parent class but is also free to define new attributes and methods of its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The __init__() Method for a Child Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task Python has when creating an instance from a child class is to assign values to all attributes in the parent class. To do this, the `__init__()` method for a child class needs help from its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let’s model a comic book. A comic book is just a specific kind of book, with less text and more images :). Consequently, we can base our new `ComicBook` class on the `Book` class we wrote earlier. Then we’ll only have to write code for the attributes and behavior specific to comic books.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a child class, the parent class **must be part of the current file and must appear before the child class in the file**. The name of the parent class must be included in parentheses in the definition of the child class. The `__init__()` method takes the information required to make a `ComicBook` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` function is a special function that helps Python make connections between the parent and child class. It tells Python to call the `__init__()` method from `ComicBook`’s parent class, which gives a `ComicBook` instance all the attributes of its parent class. The name super comes from a convention of calling the parent class a **superclass** and the child class a **subclass**."
