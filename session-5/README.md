# Qualification seminar teaching materials 2018

This repository contains the course materials for the third session of the qualification seminar.

In case the notebooks do not get rendered on Github, you should be able to read them here:

## Getting the Lecture Notes

Navigate on the command line to the directory in which you would like to store the lecture notes for this seminar. For example if you have a directory `Documents` in your home directory, you could store the material there:

```bash
$ cd Documents
```
Now _clone_ this material. In essence, _cloning_ means copy all the stuf to my machine.
**OBS**: You have to do this step only once!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/itu-summer/qualification-seminar-materials-2018.git
```

Everytime you want to refresh the material, i.e., get our latest update, you run the following:

```bash
$ cd qualification-seminar-materials-2018
$ git pull
```
