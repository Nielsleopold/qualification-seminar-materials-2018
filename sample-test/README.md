# Sample test

An example test is given in the `zip` file `sample-test.zip`.

The sample is designed to look just like the actual test.
For the test you will also receive a `zip` file you will have to extract,
before you can access the actual questions.

## How to solve the test
The solutions should be placed inside a folder carrying your name and your
ITU id, like so: `sol-XXX` where `sol` is the name and `XXX` is the
student id.
The actual test will be downloaded as a `zip` file, and the solution will have
to be uploaded as a `zip` file, so it is easier for you if you have it in
a single directory. 

An example of such a folder is seen in the `sol-sabine-musterman` folder, where
each question is given a corresponding file: sometimes an answer is a text file,
sometimes it is a python file. 
What type of file you have to create should be clear from the question.

## Recommended use of this sample test

We would recommend that you only look at this after the 9th session, where
you should have all the necessary tools to solve all the tasks.
When you feel ready to have a go at it, try to sit down and mentally prepare to
work on this for 4 hours sharp - just like you will have for the actual test.
After the 4 hours, evaluate what went well and what didn't.

Also, try to include all the practical stuff in your 4 hours.
When you are sitting with the actual test you will have to download the file from
learnit, unzip it and open the files. You will also have to compress (zip) all your
answers and upload it in the end.
All this should happen **within** the 4 hours, so don't forget to practice that.

Finally, be aware of the time you spend on each assignment.
It is not a good idea to spend 3 hours on the first question, because you will
have very little time for the remaining tasks.

## A note about practicalities and aids

For the actual test you should use the **ITU wifi** (`ITU++` or `ITU`) where you are
**signed in with your ITU account**. 
This is important because ITU turns off internet access for the duration of your test
- except for the ones that need it: you!
But, you will only have access to the learnit page that exposes the test `zip` file. 
You will **not** be able to access learnit fora or any other webpage.

However, you can bring your laptop with any file on it you want, as well as any book
or printed paper you would like.
