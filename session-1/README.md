# Qualfication seminar 2018 - Session 1

This repository contains the course materials for the first session of the qualification seminar.

The session contains a notebook (called `Notebook.ipynb`). With your ITU account, which is also a Microsoft LiveID, you can open the notebooks on _Azure Notebooks_ by clicking on: [![AzureNB](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/itu-summer/session-1)

## Material lifecycle

Each session will be updated in three steps:
* Before the session starts we will publish the material you need to follow the session. In the current directory the `Notebook.ipynb` file is all that you need.
* After the session is over, we will publish all our slides, solutions to code exercises in the class as well as information on the homework.
* Finally, after the homework har been handed in, the homework solutions will be published.
  * We strongly recommend that you validate/verify your results.
